## FilmQueryProject

This is my first project using MySQL database and working with joins. It was
actually pretty easy to get the information I wanted out of the database once I got
used to the syntax. MySQL seems pretty easy to use so far.  

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use joins to access information that is stored in multiple tables of 
a database. I also developed a better understanding of how we connect to the database
to Java and how dependencies work. The additional practice using maps and lists to 
store and manipulate data was helpful as well.

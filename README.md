## FilmQueryProject

This is my first project using MySQL database and working with joins. It was
actually pretty easy to get the information I wanted out of the database once I got
used to the syntax.  

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use joins to get information from different parts of a database.
I also developed a better understanding of how we connect to the database through
Java and how dependency works. 


## Technologies used
* MySQL
* Java

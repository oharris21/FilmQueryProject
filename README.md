## FilmQueryProject

This is my first project using MySQL database and working with joins. It was
actually pretty easy to get the information I wanted out of the database once I got
used to the syntax. MySQL seems pretty user friendly so far.  

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use joins to link information from different parts of a database
together. I also developed a better understanding of how we connect to the database
through Java and how dependency works. The additional practice using maps and lists
was helpful too. 


## Technologies used
